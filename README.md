After downloading the dataset to my local computer, I used **Power BI** as the primary tool for data loading, cleaning, and transformation.

## Data Loading and Initial Transformation

- Imported the dataset as a CSV file using the **Get Data** command.
- Opened **Power Query Editor** for cleaning and transformation.

## Data Quality Assessment

- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formatting.
- Standardized date, text, and categorical fields.
- Ensured proper data types were assigned.

## Data Formatting and Integration

- Reformatted all columns (dates, text, prices, quantities).
- Ensured column consistency and accuracy.
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into Power BI for modeling.

## KPI Calculation

- Created calculated measures using **DAX**.
- Built KPIs for Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, etc.
- Validated all cleaning steps before proceeding to visualization.
