# Pizza_Sales_Analysis
Comprehensive Pizza Sales Analytics using Power BI

## Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end analysis of a pizza restaurant’s 2015 sales performance using Power BI.
The goal was to uncover sales trends, customer behavior patterns, order dynamics, and revenue performance across multiple dimensions such as pizza categories, sizes, order types, and time periods.

Through interactive dashboards, this analysis provides clear insights into what drives the restaurant’s performance — revealing best-selling products, customer ordering habits, and opportunities for revenue growth.
